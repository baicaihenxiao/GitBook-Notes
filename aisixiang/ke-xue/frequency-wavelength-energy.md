## Introduction:

As shown in the electromagnetic spectrum above, the types of electromagnetic radiation can be described by their frequency, wavelength or energy.

A wave is a traveling disturbance that carries energy from one place to another.  Energy is the ability to do work or cause a change. Waves can be measured using wavelength and frequency.  The highest points of waves are called crests.  The lowest points of waves are called troughs.  The distance from one crest to the next is called a wavelength (λ).&#x20;

&#x20; ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png>)

The number of complete wavelengths in a given unit of time is called frequency (f).  As a wavelength increases in size, its frequency and energy (E) decrease. &#x20;

**f = c / λ     and     λ = c / f     and    E = h•f  (or E = h•c/ λ)**

所有的波都传播能量，最常见的波是 Mechanical Waves 和 Electromagnetic Waves

> There are two types of waves that are most commonly studied in [classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical\_physics): [**mechanical waves**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical\_wave) and [**electromagnetic waves**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\_wave). In a mechanical wave, [stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress\_\(mechanics\)) and [strain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain\_\(mechanics\)) fields oscillate about a mechanical equilibrium. A mechanical wave is a local [deformation (strain)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation\_\(physics\)) in some physical medium that propagates from particle to particle by creating local [stresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress\_\(mechanics\)) that cause strain in neighboring particles too. For example, [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound) waves are variations of the local [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound\_pressure) and [particle motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle\_velocity) that propagate through the medium. Other examples of mechanical waves are [seismic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic\_wave), [gravity waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity\_wave), [surface waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface\_wave) and [string vibrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String\_vibration). In an electromagnetic wave (such as light), coupling between the electric and magnetic fields sustains propagation of waves involving these fields according to [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's\_equations). Electromagnetic waves can travel through a [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum) and through some [dielectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric) media (at wavelengths where they are considered [transparent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency\_and\_translucency)). Electromagnetic, as determined by their frequencies (or [wavelengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength)), have more specific designations including [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio\_wave), [infrared radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared\_radiation), [terahertz waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terahertz\_waves), [visible light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible\_light), [ultraviolet radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet\_radiation), [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray) and [gamma rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma\_ray).
>
> ther types of waves include [**gravitational waves**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational\_wave), which are disturbances in [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime) that propagate according to [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General\_relativity); [heat diffusion waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat\_equation); [plasma waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma\_wave) that combine mechanical deformations and electromagnetic fields; [reaction–diffusion waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion\_system), such as in the [Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky\_reaction); and many more. Mechanical and electromagnetic waves transfer [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy),[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave#cite\_note-1) [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum\_\(physics\)), and [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information), but they do not transfer particles in the medium. In mathematics and [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics) waves are studied as [signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave#cite\_note-2) On the other hand, some waves have [envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope\_\(waves\)) which do not move at all such as [standing waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing\_wave) (which are fundamental to music) and [hydraulic jumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic\_jump).

Mechanical Waves 分为 transverse waves, longitudinal waves, and surface waves.

> In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), a mechanical wave is a [wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave) that is an oscillation of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter), and therefore transfers energy through a [material medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission\_medium).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical\_wave#cite\_note-1) (Vacuum is, from classical perspective, a non-material medium, where [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\_radiation) propagate.)
>
> While waves can move over long distances, the movement of the medium of transmission—the material—is limited. Therefore, the oscillating material does not move far from its initial equilibrium position. Mechanical waves can be produced only in media which possess [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity\_\(physics\)) and [inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia). There are three types of mechanical waves: [transverse waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse\_wave), [longitudinal waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal\_wave), and [surface waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface\_wave). Some of the most common examples of mechanical waves are water waves, sound waves, and [seismic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic\_waves).
>
> Like all waves, mechanical waves transport [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy). This energy [propagates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave\_propagation) in the same direction as the wave. A wave requires an initial energy input; once this initial energy is added, the wave travels through the medium until all its energy is transferred. In contrast, [electromagnetic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\_radiation) require no medium, but can still travel through one.

Electromagnetic Waves 都是 transverse waves，不需要介质传播

> In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), electromagnetic radiation (EMR) consists of [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave) of the [electromagnetic (EM) field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\_field), which propagate through [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space) and carry [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum) and electromagnetic [radiant energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant\_energy).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\_radiation#cite\_note-1) Types of EMR include [**radio waves**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio\_wave)**,** [**microwaves**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave)**,** [**infrared**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared)**,** [**(visible) light**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light)**,** [**ultraviolet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet)**,** [**X-rays**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray)**, and** [**gamma rays**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma\_ray), all of which are part of the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\_spectrum).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\_radiation#cite\_note-2)
>
> [Classically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical\_electromagnetism), electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized [oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation) of [electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric\_field) and [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic\_field). In a vacuum, electromagnetic waves travel at the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed\_of\_light), commonly denoted _c_. There, depending on the frequency of oscillation, different wavelengths of electromagnetic spectrum are produced. In homogeneous, isotropic media, the oscillations of the two fields are on average perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation, forming a [transverse wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse\_wave). The position of an electromagnetic wave within the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\_spectrum) can be characterized by either its [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) of oscillation or its [wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength). Electromagnetic waves of different frequency are called by different names since they have different sources and effects on matter. In order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength these are: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\_radiation#cite\_note-3)
>
> Electromagnetic waves are emitted by electrically [charged particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged\_particle) undergoing acceleration,[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\_radiation#cite\_note-Cloude-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\_radiation#cite\_note-Bettini-5) and these waves can subsequently interact with other charged particles, exerting force on them. EM waves carry energy, [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum), and [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular\_momentum) away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter) with which they interact. Electromagnetic radiation is associated with those EM waves that are free to propagate themselves ("radiate") without the continuing influence of the moving charges that produced them, because they have achieved sufficient distance from those charges. Thus, EMR is sometimes referred to as the [far field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near\_and\_far\_field). In this language, the [near field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near\_and\_far\_field) refers to EM fields near the charges and current that directly produced them, specifically [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\_induction) and [electrostatic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic\_induction) phenomena.
